# LazyToday
Simple app that lets you delay an item from Priority Matrix that is overdue today to tomorrow, created to show how Appfluence's API works.

You need a token to authorize the petitions to the API, it is obtainable [here](https://sync.appfluence.com/o/authorized_tokens/). 


## Execution example
With this example, I will show an execution of the app that shows some tasks that are overdue today, then I ask to delay one of them, and I execute the program again to check and now decline to delay any task.
